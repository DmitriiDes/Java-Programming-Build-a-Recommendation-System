Comments: Coursera assignment requires to use Arraylist as a dat structures. However, I think more efficient will be usage of HashMap.

In my code I convert HashMaps to ArrayLists to meet requirements of the issignment. However, If you are planning to use this code anywhere, please feel free to comment off conversion and use HashMaps instead as it's faster and more convenient.
